                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Business in practice was a combination of a simulation software, lectures, as well as workshops that tried to guide us on how to become better in what we have already learnt, whether that meant marketing, finance, HR, or operations. BIP actually gave me a platform where even though it was simulated, I got a sense of what a true work environment would actually feel like. What we essentially did is take part as a board of directors of different departments. Using what we've learnt throughout our course, we put our learnings into the practical use, in order to bring profits to our company.
                 <br> <br>I think I really enjoyed this module because it really taught me a lot about teamwork in terms of understanding each other's weaknesses or strength and using that to strengthen the team. I believe, this will definitely help me in my career. <a href="personal.html#certificates">View Certificate</a><br></p>

We were required to implement IoT and come up with an innovative idea that could potentially solve an every day issue. For this project, I came up with the idea of an Inventory tracking prototype mobile app for refridgerators. Various sensors placed within the fridge would keep track of inventory and this can be viewed at any time on your smartphone with the custom made app to support this system. Our project was chosen as top 5 for having great potential.
